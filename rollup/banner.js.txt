/**********************************************************************
 * The JavaScript in this file is an EXPERIMENTATION of the
 * Kartographer extension customized for Wikivoyage.
 *
 * This is a generated bundle file. The code is free and open source
 * and can be found at:
 *     https://github.com/juliengirault/wikivoyage-maps
 *
 * WHAT IS IT DOING ?
 *
 * In a few words, this code listens to a mediawiki hook, `wikivoyage.maps`
 * and adds a few features onto the basic Kartographer map:
 *
 * - Adds a control (top right) to select a different tile layer and toggle
 *   overlays:
 *     - Adds tile layers (mapnik, mapquestopen, mapquest, landscape)
 *     - Adds overlays (traffic, maplabels, boundaries, hill, cycling, hiking)
 * - Adds a control (top left) to show the Nearby Articles from enwikivoyage.
 * - Adds a scale control (bottom left).
 *
 * Please find or ask for more information in the Phabricator ticket:
 *     https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T132971
 *
 * HOW CAN YOU HELP ?
 *
 * We need to collect feedback, about the experimentation itself, about the
 * features, the design, the user experience, the code... We also need to
 * start tracking bugs and fixing them. Please help.
